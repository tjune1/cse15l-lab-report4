# Fourth Lab Report - Jun T.
For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.


**Step 4: Log into ieng6**

To log into ieng6, I typed the command `ssh cs15lsp23si@ieng6.ucsd.edu` and then pressed the key `<enter>` to execute the command. Since in lab we're required to do the step "Generating SSH Keys for ieng6," I don't need to be prompted for entering a password anymore. 

**Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account**
  


**Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**

**Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test**

**Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed**

**Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account**
